## Paper: Adversarial representation learning for robust patient-independent epileptic seizure detection

## Description
Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10868

## Overview
This repository contains the codes for reproducing the adversarial_seizure_detection model of the paper titled "Adversarial representation learning for robust patient-independent epileptic seizure detection"

## Dependencies

If you are using conda, it is recommended to switch to a new virtual environment.

## Requirements

1. Tensorflow 1.15
2. Python 3.7
* If you plan to use GPU computation, install CUDA

## Data preparation
Download the data from the following box folder.
https://uofi.box.com/s/z2ji0ilz1n7ylamv1v3s5pa4bmo9imyc

## File description
1. model.py -> script used for the three CNN models 
2. util.py -> script used to load the configruation file, log the hyperparameter and save the test results
3. adversarial_seizure_detection.py ->script used for loading the data, trainning and evaluating the model
4. Baseline_models.ipynb -> scritp used for baseline SVM & RF model 

## Hyperparameter Setting

* Please edit the params.json file to update the model's hyperparameter

## Training & Evaluation

* To train and evaluate the model performance, run the following commands.

$ python adversarialSeizureDectection.py

* When training & evaluation is completed, it will generate the following files:
1. Log file---record the hyperparameter values for the test
2. test results csv file---record the each subject test results
3. 4 cost loss data files
4. 5 attention outputs files
