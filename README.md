## Paper: Adversarial representation learning for robust patient-independent epileptic seizure detection

## Description
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10868

## Overview
This repository contains the codes for reproducing the adversarial_seizure_detection model of the paper titled "Adversarial representation learning for robust patient-independent epileptic seizure detection"

## File description
1. model.py -> script used for the three CNN models 
2. util.py -> script used to load the configruation file, log the hyperparameter and save the test results
3. adversarial_seizure_detection.py ->script used for running the model

## Dependencies

If you are using conda, it is recommended to switch to a new virtual environment.

## Requirements

1. Tensorflow 1.15
2. Python 3.7
