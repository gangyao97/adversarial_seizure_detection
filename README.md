File description
1. model.py -> script used for the three CNN models 
2. util.py -> script used to load the configruation file, log the hyperparameter and save the test results
3. adversarial_seizure_detection.py ->script used for running the model

Dependencies

If you are using conda, it is recommended to switch to a new virtual environment.

Requirements

Tensorflow 1.15
Python 3.7
